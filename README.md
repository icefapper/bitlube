####Description
utility that consumes a sequence of numeric indices and produces a bit stream with bits at those indices set 

####Usage
supply bitlube with *an ascending* list of numbers. **__an ascending list of numbers__**! it's so dumb it won't work otherwise.

####Example
(Please note, the "echo" in this example is used for demonstration purposes. bitlube reads its required data from the standard input.)

```
$ echo 1 40   | bitlube
```

The above, for example, produces 0100000000000000000000000000000000000001
